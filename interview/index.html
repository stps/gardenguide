            <b><h4 class="heading question">How would you compare the garden at the Japan House to a traditional tea garden in Japan?</h4></b>
            <p><b>JIM:</b> My goal has really been to make that as accurate as I possibly can with the money available, which is a big issue; and I have seen, now--well, I should say that, I have been back to Japan now, about eight (8) times, I think. I’ve seen the whole country, top to bottom, many times; and I’ve seen probably almost all the major gardens, and a lot of the minor gardens as well, including tea gardens. Now, tea gardens are not too visible in Japan. They’re very private; you don’t go into them unless you’re invited, for the most part; many of them are associated with temples, especially in Kyoto; and the gardens are off a ways if you’re going through a tour of other gardens in the temple, you’ll see that tea gardens are off a ways and that’s about your only view of it. So, it’s very difficult, even for Japanese, to see a tea garden. But with my research and everything, I felt I was doing what I thought was accurate down to every detail. The basic parts of the tea garden being two parts: the inner garden and the outer garden. That’s the main breakdown of the garden. And then the use of fencing, the use of trees, the use of the contrast between the outer garden and the inner garden, as far as plants; this kind of thing. That’s pretty easy to follow with what the Japanese would do.  Someone asked me when I first started the tea garden, “Where are you going to get all the Japanese plants?” Well, as it turns out you can go to a local nursery and get a lot of them, because, when you look at what was the origin of many plants sold commercially, I would say, could be as many as 60% in a nursery, had come, originally, either from China, Korea, or Japan. So the common Japanese Yew that everybody uses around their house, is used in Japanese gardens, of course. Korean Boxwoods are also the same way. I'm using them here. So I’m not deviating too much from what they would have in Japan. But, yes, you have to choose plants that are going to survive, especially this winter of minus 10, minus 15 degrees. Kyoto doesn’t have that, Kyoto is like northern Virginia, persay.</p>

            <b><h4 class="heading question">What kind of creative vision did you have originally? How has this vision changed over time?</h4></b>
            <p><b>JIM:</b> Gardens always go in for change. You never really expect to have a garden permanently the same all the time. There have even been studies about the very historic, classic gardens in Japan, and what was it really like when it was originally built. And as it turns out a lot of changes have gone through the years on even the famous garden. And so, you can expect that, even here. After I put something on paper, and even while I’m constructing it, trying to follow what I have on paper, I visually see that things are not quite right, that maybe the bush needs to be moved over another two feet from what i had planned, or a tree needs to be moved to another spot, or maybe a different tree should be in that spot: this kind of a thing. And so that happens with the actual construction of it. But once the garden is built and it's now growing, like I told everybody, ‘wait ten years, and then you’ll have a garden’. So when you put it in, it’s quite small. But as it grows, I began to say, ‘Ah, that should be changed, maybe that should be changed’. So I have done a number of things on both gardens, the dry garden and the tea garden, that try to improve it. And that never ends. So even this year we may do something different that we haven’t done before.</p>
