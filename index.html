                    <p>Welcome to the Japan House Gardens. I am James Bier, designer and builder of the gardens and would like to take you through the five stops along the walk explaining the concepts and details about Japanese gardens that might help you more to enjoy your stroll around Japan House. Take your time and absorb details as you go along.</p>

                    <p>There are more than one kind of Japanese Garde, mostly tied to the country's history and they can be classified in four or five categories. The oldest style is a Hill and Pond Garden, used sparingly but going back to its roots in the Heian Period of 794-1185. Only a few remnants of these original gardens exist today in Japan but modification of this concept can be found at temples and modern gardens outside of religious areas.</p>

                    <p>Beginning at the end of the 12th Century, with the introduction of Zen Buddhism from China, came the concept of the Dry Garden, the raked gravel and rocks so commonly imagined in the West as THE Japanese garden. The idea of a raked gravel area associated with a shrine and being a sacred area goes back to at least 300 B.C. with Shintoism and animism, the original religions of Japan. The concept of raked gravel in the dry gardens we see now has borrowed this concept but not seeing it sacred but more respectful.</p>
