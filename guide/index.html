                                <p class="p-1">Welcome to Japan House Gardens. My name is James Bier, designer and builder of the gardens. I would like to take you through the six stops along the walk explaining the concepts and details about Japanese gardens that might help you enjoy your stroll around Japan House. Take your time and absorb details as you go along.</p>

                                <p>There are more than one kind of Japanese garden, mostly tied to the country's history and they can be classified in four or five categories. The oldest style is a Hill and Pond Garden, used sparingly but going back to its roots in the Heian Period of 794-1185. Only a few remnants of these original gardens exist today in Japan but modification of this concept can be found at temples and modern gardens outside of religious areas.</p>

                                <p>Beginning at the end of the 12th Century, with the introduction of Zen Buddhism from China, came the concept of the Dry Garden, the raked gravel and rocks so commonly imagined in the West as THE Japanese garden. The idea of a raked gravel area associated with a shrine and being a sacred area goes back to at least 300 B.C. with Shintoism and animism, the original religions of Japan.  The concept of raked gravel in the dry gardens we see now has borrowed this concept but not seeing it sacred but more as respectful.</p>

                                <p>In the beginning of the 17th Century, tea was re-introduced to Japan from China which led to the art of tea drinking, the Tea Ceremony, and the development of the Tea Garden used to prepare the guests for and to compliment the artful, refined way of drinking tea with friends. About that same time, small enclosed gardens were introduced in Kyoto by wealthy merchants.  Houses at that time were taxed by the width of the house fronting the street.  So, to circumvent that, lots and houses were made narrow but to go back a lengthy distance and butting up against the neighbors' houses. To get ventilation and sunlight inside the house, small areas in the house were opened up to the sky but enclosed on three or four sides by rooms of sliding shoji and walls. This area was landscaped from ideas borrowed from the dry and tea gardens to its own style called the Courtyard Garden. Thus, one or more gardens could be viewed from different rooms of the house in a very private setting. This concept spread and is found in many enclosed areas outside the home, bringing nature close to the building especially in dense urban settings. The gardens widely vary in size but are often small, no more than 108 square feet (12 m^2) in size.</p>

                                <p>A fourth style of garden is on a grand scale, focusing on a pond or series of ponds, and has paths around the rim allowing special aesthetic views at various points to be admired. This is called a Stroll or Walking Garden.  I will talk more about this garden at our last stop. Another category of Japanese garden is emerging which I will call a Residence Garden, which combines the ideas of all other gardens in original uses. Not only are they found in residences but also today in restaurants, hotels, business offices and other places. In the past, many excellent gardens were private and were not viewed by the public but now some are becoming more well-known and some made accessible to the public.</p>

                                <p>At Japan House we have two major gardens, the Tea Garden and Dry Garden available for you to walk through at your pleasure. The Japan House front door area is somewhat enclosed but it has not been suitable to create as a Courtyard Garden and the pond in front of Japan House is planned someday to be a Stroll Garden.  At the back entrance to Japan House is the Gunji Chabana Garden containing a variety of plants used in lkebana, Japanese flower arranging. Most of the plants there have a Japanese origin.  In time, we expect to expand the area with more varieties native to Japan. At the north parking lot past the Cherry Blossom Walkway is an Entrance Garden. While it does not follow a traditional style of garden, it does contain elements used in the other gardens.</p>

                                <p class="p-1">A Tea Garden, called Cha Niwa in Japanese, is an intimate garden, designed for a small number of people and, for that reason, it is rarely available to the public to visit in Japan.  With a visit to the country to see gardens, you will most likely see a tea garden only in casual passing, if recognized at all.  Japan House's garden is large and more literal in its concept and presentation than usually seen in Japan, and certainly more accessible.</p>

                                <p>The concept of design is that you are leaving a structured, urban environment and are going up into a mountain forest to be with Nature, to have a bowl of tea with a friend living in a rustic setting. To create this, a path is laid out to follow as an up-andÂ­-down mountain trail.  The hill was here before construction and was perfect, with modification, to carry this concept.  The path is often called the Dewy Path because before guests arrive, the plants and rocks are watered down to bring out freshness and color to the landscape.  In Japan so often, the tea gardens are so flat and simple that a strong imagination is needed to create the mood.  It is also most common to have the tea room built as part of a main building as we have here rather than have a separate tea house.</p>

                                <p>All tea gardens are divided into two parts, the Outer Garden and the Inner Garden. Often the whole garden in Japan is no bigger than our Outer Garden that you see across to the main gate. The bamboo fence and gate to the right is the division between the two gardens. The Outer Garden is meant to be predominantly evergreen but with some deciduous plants, also, more formal in pruning and arrangement, and more open in space.  It is just the opposite for the Inner Garden, more deciduous, more natural growth, and a feeling of forest cover.</p>

                                <p>For the Tea Ceremony , the guests number no more than five or six.  They would arrive at the main gate and proceed in, to the waiting bench, koshikake in Japanese, moving ahead to the hill and seat themselves above one of the flat foot stones, the tallest stone at the end of the bench being for the main guest.   It would then be time to relax, converse, and enjoy the garden setting and individual plants.  After a time, the host or hostess would come from the tea house or room into the Inner Garden and approach the bamboo gate, inviting the guests into the Inner Garden and to tea.  The guests enter and proceed to the water basin.</p>
